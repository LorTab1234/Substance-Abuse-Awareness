                            <h1>What are the factors that may cause Substance Abuse?</h1>
                            <p>There are multiple factors that may cause or lead to abusing substances. It depends on the case but generally, substance abuse
                                is usually caused either due to mental stress/trauma, the addictive nature of the drug they are using, or because they were forced
                                to or just did it for the sake of doing it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The most common cause for Substance abuse however is as a result of mental issues such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder
                                or (PTSD), attention deficit disorder etc. Substance abuse is a way for a temporary escape from this reality as regularly using these 
                                substances can lead to the effects of their mental illness to be numbed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This can therefore lead to people relying on drugs and alcohol to relieve the mental and/or physical pain they are feeling despite knowing
                                the disadvantages abusing drugs may cause. That is why it is imperative to never use drugs and alcohol as the only answer to relieve any mental
                                and/or physical stress. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Alternative ways such as outreaching for help, participating in Substance Abuse Awareness initiatives and events, venting any frustrations and experiences
                                to therapists are safer and more effective ways to potentially mentally and physically heal individuals.
